Hello GitHub !

Finally on the right path to becoming an employable coder long due.
I hope to help others here and hopefully help myself emerge abit more into coding doing so.

I have almost finished the Sololearn C# course in an app alongside a 4H intro course on youtube for C# using VS.
This is my next step to explore and I will be looking for some kind of project to contribute to while I 
learn more skills needed for job applications.

As a hobby many years ago I experimented alot with CMS e107 and abit with php alone after I did a highschool course of web-developing.

Never really learned the skills to build a website that I myself wanted back then but I still made a few workably sites.
One custom theme for a veteran car site who dealt with imports from USA. Aswell a gaming site for a team.
